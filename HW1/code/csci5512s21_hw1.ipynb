    "a). You are given a biased coin whose probability of giving Heads is p. You do not know what p is. How will you use this biased coin to simulate generation of samples from the equivalent to an unbiased coin whose probability of giving heads is 1 in 2? 1 in 3? The goal is to find a simple algorithm which can convert a sequence of tosses from a biased coin with an unknown bias into a sampler which returns unbiased samples of events with probability 0.5. Briefly explain your logic for both the cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "b). Write a python program which generates at least 10 unbiased samples of prob 1/2 for each of the biased coin flip probabilities [0.01, 0.1, 0.4]. Similarly, generate 10 unbiased samples of prob 1/3 for each of the biased coin flip probabilities [0.01, 0.1, 0.4].   \n",

Now, to restrict $X$ to take only $0$ and $1$, so that we have $P(X=0)+P(X=1)=1$, we need to discard the outcomes of the two tosses of the biased coin which give HH or TT.
